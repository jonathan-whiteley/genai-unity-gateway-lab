# MAGIC # Classroom Setup 1 — Deploy the Agent App
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook is run via `%run ./Includes/Classroom-Setup-1` from **02 Lab**.
# MAGIC It deploys the agent in `agent-app/` **for you** using the Databricks SDK — no
# MAGIC local CLI, no `.env`, no `databricks bundle`. Everything runs as the workspace
# MAGIC user executing the lab.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What it does**
# MAGIC 1. Connects with `WorkspaceClient()` (picks up your notebook credentials).
# MAGIC 2. Resolves the workspace path to `agent-app/` from this notebook's own location.
# MAGIC 3. Creates (or reuses) a per-user MLflow experiment for agent traces.
# MAGIC 4. Creates the app compute with the resources it needs attached:
# MAGIC    the experiment, and a Unity Gateway serving endpoint.
# MAGIC 5. Deploys the app source that is already synced into your workspace.
# MAGIC 6. Prints the live app URL.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The notebook is **idempotent** — re-running it reuses the existing app and
# MAGIC experiment and pushes a fresh deployment.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Configuration
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Unity Gateway model services** are **Unity Catalog securables** addressed by their
# MAGIC full name (`catalog.schema.name`) — *not* workspace serving endpoints. This lab exposes
# MAGIC every model service in one schema (`MODEL_SERVICE_SCHEMA`), and the app renders a
# MAGIC **dropdown** so the user can pick which one the agent uses per message — the
# MAGIC `<schema>.*` wildcard.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Because they live in Unity Catalog, access is governed by UC grants: the setup below
# MAGIC grants the app's service principal `USE CATALOG` / `USE SCHEMA` on the parents and
# MAGIC `EXECUTE` on **each** model service in the schema (the app SP can only call what it's
# MAGIC been granted). The agent sets `use_ai_gateway=True`, so calls flow through the gateway
# MAGIC control plane where rate limits, budgets, usage tracking, and service policies apply.

# COMMAND ----------

# The Unity Catalog schema (catalog.schema) whose model services the lab exposes.
MODEL_SERVICE_SCHEMA = "labuser_matthew_mccoy.ts_ai_gateway"

# The model service selected by default (must live in MODEL_SERVICE_SCHEMA). The
# dropdown lets the user switch to any other model service in the schema.
DEFAULT_MODEL_SERVICE = f"{MODEL_SERVICE_SCHEMA}.gpt-5-5"

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Upgrade SDK for AppResourceExperiment support
# MAGIC %pip install --upgrade databricks-sdk -q
# MAGIC dbutils.library.restartPython()

# MAGIC ### Resolve paths, user, and a per-user app name
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The app source lives at `../agent-app` relative to this `Includes/` notebook. We
# MAGIC derive its absolute workspace path from *this* notebook's path so the setup works
# MAGIC no matter which user cloned the repo or where. The app name is derived from your
# MAGIC username so multiple learners in the same workspace don't collide, and follows the
# MAGIC `agent-*` naming convention.

# MAGIC ### Create (or reuse) the MLflow experiment
# MAGIC

# MAGIC ### Define the app resources
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **experiment** — destination for the agent's traces (must be named `experiment`
# MAGIC   to match `valueFrom: "experiment"` in `app.yaml` and `manifest.yaml`).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The Unity Gateway model service is **not** an app resource — it's a Unity Catalog
# MAGIC securable governed by a UC grant (done in a later cell), and passed to the app as a
# MAGIC plain env var. So the only resource we attach here is the experiment.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Grant the app access to the model services
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Reaching a model service is a UC grant — the first of the three control points from the
# MAGIC lecture ("can this principal reach the endpoint at all?"). Because the dropdown lets the
# MAGIC user pick **any** model service in the schema, we grant at the **schema** level so the
# MAGIC app's service principal gets three inherited privileges:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **`USE CATALOG`** on the parent catalog, and **`USE SCHEMA`** on the schema — without
# MAGIC   these traversal grants UC *hides* the objects, and the app sees them as `does not
# MAGIC   exist` even with EXECUTE on the model service itself.
# MAGIC - **`EXECUTE` on the schema** — in Unity Catalog, `EXECUTE` on a schema is **inherited by
# MAGIC   every model service in it, including ones created later**. This is the key to making
# MAGIC   new models appear in the dropdown *and* be callable automatically: add a model service
# MAGIC   to the schema and it just works — no re-run of this notebook, no redeploy. (A per-service
# MAGIC   grant would only cover the services that existed when this ran.)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC > **Beta note:** a model service is Unity Catalog securable type `MODEL_SERVICE`. `SCHEMA`
# MAGIC > and `CATALOG` are standard securable types. `grants.update` takes the type as a plain
# MAGIC > string. The cell is best-effort: if a grant fails, it prints guidance and continues, so
# MAGIC > an instructor can grant access in the UI (Catalog Explorer → Permissions).

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### Deploy the app source
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `deploy_and_wait` reads the source from the workspace path (already synced with the
# MAGIC repo) and blocks until the deployment `SUCCEEDS`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Wiring the agent to the gateway:** we pass two env vars as deployment overrides:
# MAGIC `GATEWAY_MODEL_SERVICE` (the default model) and `MODEL_SERVICE_SCHEMAS` (the schema the
# MAGIC dropdown lists and the agent restricts requests to). The agent sets `use_ai_gateway=True`
# MAGIC and routes each request to the chosen model service — which the app SP now has `EXECUTE`
# MAGIC on — through the gateway.

# COMMAND ----------
